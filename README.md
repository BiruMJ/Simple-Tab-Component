# Simple-Tab-Component
🧩 A simple and clean tab component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — switches tab content dynamically without any libraries.
This project is inspired by roadmap.sh.

🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a tabbed interface where each tab shows unique content. When a user clicks on a tab:
> The previously active content is hidden
> The clicked tab and its associated content are activated

💡 Key Features
✅ Built with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
✅ Each tab has its own unique content
✅ Only one tab's content is visible at a time
✅ For loop used for iteration (instead of forEach) for better beginner understanding
✅ Click event handling with addEventListener()
✅ Custom function handles activation logic
